*1004,A
Warning 1004: FLAGS statement obsolete - mapping old flags to
new options.

The FLAGS statement, used in previous versions of ABEL, has been
replaced with the OPTIONS statement in ABEL-HDL. In most cases the
old-style flags specified in a FLAGS statement will be
automatically mapped to the proper options.
*1005,A
Syntax Error 1005: Identifier length exceeds nn chars.

Identifiers (module, device, signal and constant names) must not
exceed the indicated length.
*1006,A
Syntax Error 1006: Undefined token

An unrecognized sequence of non-alphabetic characters was
encountered in the source file.
*1007,A
Syntax Error 1007: String length exceeds nn chars.

A string was encountered that exceeds the maximum allowable number
of characters. This is usually an indication that the terminating
string delimiter was unintentionally omitted.
*1008,A
Syntax Error 1008: Only ^b, ^o, ^d or ^h radix allowed.

The ^ (circumflex) character was encountered in the source file
with an unknown radix character immediately following it.

Syntax Error 1011: Actual argument length exceeds 35 chars.

An actual argument (the text passed as an argument to a macro
or module) exceeds the indicated maximum number of characters.
*1012,A
Syntax Error 1012: No more than nn arguments are declared.

The macro or module being processed has only the indicated
number of dummy arguments declared, and the macro or module was
called with too many actual arguments.
*1013,A
Warning 1013: Attribute 'FEED_OR' is obsolete - substituting
'.D' instead.

The 'FEED_OR' signal attribute was used in previous versions of
ABEL to specify the feedback configuration for the indicated
signal. In ABEL-HDL, the feedback path is specified as a part of
the related design description by using dot extensions. The
appropriate dot extension to indicated the combinatorial feedback
path from a registered output is typically '.D', so this dot
extension will be appended to all affected signals when they are
referenced as inputs.
*1014,A
Warning 1014: Attribute 'FEED_PIN' is obsolete - substituting
'.PIN' instead.

The 'FEED_PIN' signal attribute was used in previous versions of
ABEL to specify the feedback configuration for the indicated
signal. In ABEL-HDL, the feedback path is specified as a part of
the related design description by using dot extensions. The
appropriate dot extension to indicated the feedback path from an
output pin is '.PIN', so this dot extension will be appended to
all affected signals when they are referenced as inputs.
*1015,A
Warning 1015: Attribute 'FEED_REG' is obsolete - substituting
'.FB' instead.

The 'FEED_REG' signal attribute was used in previous versions of
ABEL to specify the feedback configuration for the indicated
signal. In ABEL-HDL, the feedback path is specified as a part of
the related design description by using dot extensions. The
appropriate dot extension to indicated the registered feedback
path is typically '.FB', so this dot extension will be appended to
all affected signals when they are referenced as inputs.
*1016,A
Fatal Error 1016: Unable to open output file 'xxxx'.

The indicated file could not be opened. This can indicated a full
disk drive, invalid path, or file protection problems.
*1017,A
Syntax Error 1017: ENDCASE expected

The CASE transition statement must be terminated with an ENDCASE
statement.
*1018,A
Syntax Error 1018: No register type specified for 'xxxx'
- please use ISTYPE.

The indicated signal has not been declared with a register type. If
no device and pin number have been declared, you should use the
ISTYPE statement to specify that the signal is either combinatorial
(ISTYPE 'COM') or registered (ISTYPE 'REG' or ISTYPE 'REG_X'
where X is either D, T, SR, JK, JKD or G).
*1019,A
Syntax Error 1019: Keyword 'xxxx' expected

The indicated keyword was expected in the source file.
*1020,A
Syntax Error 1020: Identifier expected

An identifier (module, device, signal or constant name) was
expected in the source file.

Syntax Error 1021: Undefined compiler directive '@xxxx'.

An '@' sign was encountered that was followed by an unknown
directive name.
*1022,A
Syntax Error 1022: Special constant must end with a '.'.

Special constants are delimited by '.' (period) characters.
This Error can also indicated incorrect usage of dot extensions,
which are prefixed by '.' characters.
*1023,A

Syntax Error 1023: Undefined special constant 'xxxx'.

An unknown special constant was found delimited by '.' (period)
characters.
*1024,A
Syntax Error 1024: Label expected

A label was expected in the source file. A label is a sequence of
alpha-numeric characters that does not begin with a number, and is
not an ABEL-HDL reserved word (keyword).
*1025,A

Syntax Error 1025: Can't use ':=' operator with dot extension
signal 'xxxx'.

The ':=' (registered assignment) operator is used to indicated a
pin-to-pin relationship between an input expression and a
corresponding registered output pin. Dot extensions signals
are inherently combinatorial, and should therefore be described
with the '=' (unclocked assignment) operator.
*1026,A
Syntax Error 1026: ';' expected

A semicolon was expected in the source file.
*1027,A
Syntax Error 1027: Module label doesn't match 'xxxx'.

The END statement was followed by a module name that does not
match the module name specified in the previous MODULE statement.
*1028,A
Syntax Error 1028: EQUATIONS, STATE_DIAGRAM, TRUTH_TABLE or END
expected.

A keyword was encountered out of place in the source file. This can
indicate any number of syntax problems, including misplaced or
missing semicolons or parenthesis, unbalanced IF-THEN, WHEN-THEN or
CASE statements, or earlier syntax problems.
*1029,A
Syntax Error 1029: PIN, NODE, DEVICE, ISTYPE, MACRO or '='
expected.

A label, keyword or operator was encountered out of place in the
declarations section of the source file. This Error will often
result if a comma is omitted from a list of identifiers.
*1030,A
Warning 1030: Inconsistency in number of parameters - declaration
ignored.

A constant declaration statement had an unbalanced number of items
on the right and left side of the '=' (constant assignment)
operator.
*1031,A
Syntax Error 1031: Undefined label 'xxxx'.

A label was referenced that was not declared in a declarations
section of the source file.
*1032,A
Syntax Error 1032: Signal not allowed.

A signal was not allowed as an operand or argument in the
indicated expression.

Syntax Error 1035: Illegal operation on special constant.

Special constants are not allowed as operands in the indicated
expression.
*1036,A

Syntax Error 1036: Can't compare set with nn members to one with
nn members.

Set widths must match when performing operations on two sets.
*1037,A
Syntax Error 1037: ')' expected

The ')' (right parenthesis) character was expected as a delimiter.
*1038,A
Syntax Error 1038: Pin number, ISTYPE or semicolon expected.

A signal (PIN or NODE) declaration was not properly terminated.
*1039,A
Warning 1039: Label 'xxxx' is already defined - declaration ignored.

The indicated label was already used in a previous declaration. The
new declaration will be ignored. This can indicate a missing or
misplaced EQUATIONS keyword.
*1040,A
Syntax Error 1040: Number expected

A number was expected in the source file. Numbers can be prefixed
by a radix specification, or can be specified as a set of binary
values.
*1041,A
Syntax Error 1041: Keyword 'xxxx' is out of context.

The indicated keyword was used in an incorrect manner.
*1042,A
Logical Error 1042: Premature end of source file.

The end of the source file was encountered before an END
statement was found.
*1043,A
Warning 1043: ':=' should not be used with output type 'xxxx'.

The ':=' (clocked assignment) operator is intended for use with
D-type flip-flops only. For alternate flip-flop types, you should
use the '=' (combinatorial assignment) operator in conjunction
with either a '.T', '.J', '.K', '.S', '.R', or other register
input port dot extension.
*1045,A
Warning 1045: 'INVERT' or 'BUFFER' not specified for 'xxxx' -
output uncertain.

An output signal has been described using a register input port
dot extension ('.D', '.T', '.J', '.K', '.S', or '.R') but the
associated output signal has not been declared with an 'INVERT'
or 'BUFFER' attribute. Since there is no information about the
existence of an inverter between the register and the associated
output pin, the actual value observed on that pin is uncertain.
*1046,A
Syntax Error 1046: Cannot operate on signal 'xxxx'.

The indicated signal was used in an expression in which only
numbers or constant values are allowed.
*1047,A
Syntax Error 1047: Signal or .X. expected

A declared signal (pin or node) or the special constant '.X.' was
expected in the source file.
*1048,A
Syntax Error 1048: '=' or ':=' expected

An assignment operator was expected in the source file.
*1049,A
Syntax Error 1049: Expression element expected

An expression was expected in the source file. Expressions
are composed of one or more signals, sets, numbers or special
constants operated on by valid ABEL-HDL operators. Expressions
may or may not be enclosed in a pair of parenthesis.
*1050,A
Warning 1050: 'INVERT' or 'BUFFER' not specified for 'xxxx' -
feedback uncertain.

Feedback from a registered signal has been described using the '.Q'
dot extension, but the associated output signal has not been
declared with an 'INVERT' or 'BUFFER' attribute. Since there is no
information about the existence of an inverter between the register
and the associated output pin, the relationship between the value
observed on that pin and the value fed back from the register is
uncertain.
*1051,A
Syntax Error 1051: GOTO, IF or CASE expected

A state transition (GOTO, IF-THEN-ELSE, or CASE) statement was
expected.
*1052,A
Syntax Error 1052: THEN expected

The THEN portion of an IF-THEN-ELSE statement was omitted.
*1053,A
Syntax Error 1053: Signal 'xxxx' is combinatorial.

The ':=' (clocked assignment) operator was used to describe a
signal that was declared as combinatorial.
*1054,A
Syntax Error 1054: '(' expected

A '(' (left parenthesis) character was expected as a delimiter.
*1055,A
Syntax Error 1055: '->>' expected

The '->>' operator was expected to delimit the input and output
portions of a truth table or test vector header or entry.
*1056,A
Logical Error 1056: Extension 'xxxx' is not legal for node 'xxxx'.

The indicated dot extension is not appropriate for the indicated
node.

A set was specified in a test vector where a single-bit value was
expected.
*1058,A
Syntax Error 1058: Special constant not allowed.

Special constants are not allowed in the current context.
*1059,A
Syntax Error 1059: Undefined operation on sets.

Sets may not be used as operands of '>>>' (shift right),
'<<<' (shift left), '*' (multiply), '/' (divide) or '%' (modulo)
operators.
*1060,A

Syntax Error 1060: Can't map set onto a different sized set.

Set widths must match when performing operations on two sets, or
when using nested sets in truth tables or test vectors.
*1061,A
Warning 1061: No output type specified for 'xxxx' - please use
ISTYPE.

You have used the indicated signal as an output, but have not
declared whether it is combinatorial or registered.
*1062,A
Warning 1062: Extension 'xxxx' may not be legal for signal
'xxxx'.

You have used a dot extension that does not match the known dot
extensions for the output type declared for the indicated signal.

You have specified a node number that is undefined for the declared
device.
*1067,A

Syntax Error 1067: Only one label allowed.

You have specified a list of labels in a macro definition. Only one
label is allowed for each macro.
*1068,A
Syntax Error 1068: Block expected

A block was expected following a macro keyword or directive. A
block is a section of ABEL-HDL source statements enclosed by
braces.
*1069,A
Syntax Error 1069: Closing '}' of block not found.

A terminating '}' (right brace) delimiter was not found in the
source file.
*1070,A
Warning 1070: Pin number nn is already declared as 'xxxx'.

You have declared the same pin number for two different named
signals.
*1071,A
Syntax Error 1071: Closing ''' of string not found.

The terminating ''' (single quote) character was omitted from a
string. This Error can occur if a single quote (or back quote)
character is imbedded in a string without being prefixed by a '\'
(backslash) character.
*1072,A
Syntax Error 1072: ':+:' or ':*:' expected

You have specified @ALTERNATE (use alternate operators) and have
incorrectly specified an XOR or XNOR operation.
*1073,A
Syntax Error 1073: Constant label expected

The @CONST directive requires a constant label. This label must not
have been previously declared (as a signal, macro or other
identifier) except that it can be used in previous @CONST directive
statement.
*1074,A
Syntax Error 1074: '=' expected

The '=' (assignment operator) was omitted from an @CONST directive
or from a fuse assignment statement.

Syntax Error 1075: Undefined operation on signal.

A signal identifier is not legal in the current context.
*1076,A
Syntax Error 1076: Number is too large.

Numbers (either literal values or values produced by complex
expressions) must not exceed the maximum size of 32 bits
(unsigned).
*1077,A
Syntax Error 1077: ':>>' or '->>' expected

The ':>>' or '->>' operator was expected to delimit the input and
output portions of a test vector header or entry line.
*1078,A
Syntax Error 1078: ':>>' expected

The ':>>' operator was expected in a test vector entry line to
match the ':>>' operator found in the test vector header.
*1079,A
Syntax Error 1079: Radix nn is not one of 2, 8, 10 or 16.

The radix value specified in a @RADIX statement must be either 2
(binary), 8 (octal), 10 (decimal) or 16 (hexadecimal).
*1080,A
Syntax Error 1080: nn actual arguments expected

A macro or module was invoked with an incorrect number of actual
arguments.
*1081,A
Syntax Error 1081: Dummy argument expected

The '?' character indicates that the following sequence
of characters is a dummy argument. The Error indicates that the
dummy argument label does not match any of the dummy arguments
listed in the macro or module declaration.
*1082,A
Syntax Error 1082: Digit not in radix nn.

You have specified a radix value less than 10 (decimal) and have
used a digit that is not legal for that number system.

The attribute string specified in an ISTYPE statement was not
recognized as a valid signal attribute.
*1085,A
Syntax Error 1085: 'xxxx' attribute not allowed on this pin.

The specified attribute is not legal for the device and pin or node
number indicated, or the attribute conflicts with a previous
attribute specified for the same signal.
*1086,A
Warning 1086: Signal 'xxxx' has not been declared as combinatorial.

You have written a combinatorial function for the indicated signal,
but have not specified that the signal is combinatorial (ISTYPE
'COM').
*1087,A
Warning 1087: Signal 'xxxx' has not been declared as registered.

You have written a registered (pin-to-pin) function for the
indicated signal, but have not declared the signal as registered
(ISTYPE 'REG' or ISTYPE 'REG_X' where X is a register type).
*1091,A
Logical Error 1091: nn actual arguments specified on command line.

The number of actual arguments specified on the AHDL2PLA command
line exceeds the number of dummy arguments specified in the MODULE
statement.
*1092,A
Syntax Error 1092: Use '#' for OR instead of '|'.

The '|' operator (used in some programming languages for a bitwise
OR) is not used in ABEL-HDL. Instead you should use the '#'
operator.
*1093,A
Syntax Error 1093: 'xxxx' undefined, maybe 'xxxx' was meant.

An identifier was encountered that is undefined, but a similar
identifier (one that matches if upper and lower case are ignored)
exists in the design.
*1094,A
Syntax Error 1094: No operators allowed in this context.

You have attempted to use a complex expression (one containing
operators) when only signals, numbers or special constants are
allowed. This Error most frequently occurs when dot extensions
are applied to complex expressions.
*1096,A
Logical Error 1096: Arithmetic error

A divide by zero or similar situation was encountered when
evaluating an expression.
*1098,A
Syntax Error 1098: Negative declaration not allowed.

Negative (active-low) declarations are only allowed in PIN and
NODE statements.
*1099,A
Syntax Error 1099: Invalid set range.

A range (specified with the '..' operator) is bounded by
incompatible signals or numbers. Ranges must be specified that will
result in 32 or fewer set elements.
*1100,A
Syntax Error 1100: Bad element 'xxxx' in range.

The expansion of a range expression resulted in the creation of
a previously unknown (undeclared) element.
*1101,A
Syntax Error 1101: Fuse number expected

A number was expected that corresponds to a fuse location in the
previously declared device.
*1102,A
Syntax Error 1102: Fuse value 1 or 0 expected

A fuse value was expected. A value of 1 indicates an intact fuse,
and a value of 1 indicates a programmed (blown) fuse.
*1103,A
Syntax Error 1103: Illegal nested set in state diagram header.

A state diagram state register must be specified as a set of
signals, and the set must not be nested (contain other sub-sets).
*1104,A
Syntax Error 1104: Dot extension 'xxxx' not legal in this context.

The indicated dot extension is either unrecognized, or was used in
an incorrect manner. Dot extensions can only be applied to signals
or sets if signals.
*1105,A
Syntax Error 1105: Signal label expected

An identifier was used that is not a previously declared signal,
and a signal was expected.
*1109,A
Syntax Error 1109: Register type of 'xxxx' does not match other
set elements.

State diagrams require matching register types. The state register
set specified contains signals of differing register types.

Syntax Error 1111: Pin nn (GND) can't be used as input.

You have specified a device and pin number combination that cannot
be used as an input in your design.
*1113,A
Warning 1113: ENABLE keyword obsolete - use .OE extension instead.

The ENABLE keyword is no longer supported in ABEL-HDL. Instead, you
should use the '.OE' dot extension to indicate a three-state
output.
*1114,A
Syntax Error 1114: 'xxxx' attribute not allowed for state
registers.

The indicated attribute is illegal for describing state register
types. You must specify either 'COM', 'REG', or 'REG_X' where X is
a valid register type.
*1116,A
Syntax Error 1116: Multiple attribute list not allowed in this
context.

You have used the '=' operator to specify signal attributes
for signals that have not been assigned pins. You should use the
'ISTYPE' attribute to assign attributes instead of the '='
operator.
*1120,A
Syntax Error 1120: Only one device allowed.

Multiple device declarations are no longer supported in ABEL-HDL.
Instead, you should use the PLA splitter utility to split a large
design into multiple devices.
*1121,A
Syntax Error 1121: Device declaration must be made before signal
declarations.

If a device declaration is made in the source file, it must be
made before any signal declarations.
*1122,A
Logical Error 1122: File name 'xxxx.xxx' too long.

The indicated file name is too long for the operating system.
*1124,A
Warning 1124: 'INVERT' or 'BUFFER' not specified for 'xxxx' -
assuming 'buffer'.

You have not specified whether the indicated output signal will
have an inversion between the state register and the associated
output pin. No inversion will be assumed, resulting in possibly
incorrect operation if the design is implemented in a device with
inverting outputs.
*1126,A
Syntax Error 1126: Can't use ':=' operator with dot extensions.

The ':=' (clocked assignment) operator is used to describe the
operation of an registered output pin. If dot extensions are used,
you should use the '=' assignment operator, since dot extensions
(including register input ports) are inherently combinatorial.
*1128,A
Syntax Error 1128: Can't have operators in state register.

The state register set must consist of a set of signals, with no
complex operators.
*1129,A
Syntax Error 1129: Can't expand expression - possibly recursive
definition.

The AHDL2PLA compiler has detected a recursive constant
declaration. Check to make sure you have not referenced the same
identifier on both sides of the '=' operator.
*1130,A
Syntax Error 1130: Missing set element.

Set elements can consist of signals, numbers, special constants,
sets or expressions and are separated by commas. One of these items
was expected in the set.
*1131,A
Syntax Error 1131: Missing set range element.

The '..' (set range) operator was used with no second boundary
element.
*1132,A
Syntax Error 1132: Keyword IN no longer supported.

Multiple device declarations and corresponding device-specific
